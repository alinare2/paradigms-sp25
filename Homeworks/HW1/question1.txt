1.1 Scope for all variables:
    variable a has a global scope 
    variable b has a function scope
    variable c has a global scope and block scope due to variable shadowing of c
    variable d has a block scope

1.2 Explaining Excution
    Program outputs following with explanation:
    6   
        //This is the result of the console.log statement within the function if statement of a + b + c. 
        //a has been declared and intialized on the global scope as 1 using let, b has been declared and 
        //intialized to 2 on the function scope using var, and c has been declared and intialized to 3 
        //using let with variable shawdowing (overwriting the globaly declared c using var). This results in 1+2+3=6
    3
        //This is the result of the console.log statement within the function after the if statement block. This is simply the globally defined a plus the function defined b (1+2=3).
    1   
        //This is a console.log statement of the value of a which is globally defined
    20  
        //This is the console.log statement of the globally defined c value using var.
    ERROR 
        //This is a reference error due to an attempt to reference d out of its block scope.
